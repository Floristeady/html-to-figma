## Python MCP Server

**Problem:** Users need to install Node.js to run the MCP server.

**Solution:** Create a Python version of the MCP server.

**Benefits:**
- macOS and Linux have Python pre-installed
- Only Windows users would need to install Python
- Reduces friction for designers who don't have Node.js

**Effort:** ~200 lines to rewrite using Python MCP SDK

**Priority:** Low (most Claude Code/Cursor users are developers who have Node.js)
